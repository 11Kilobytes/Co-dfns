    <title>Engineering Change Log</title>
    <simpara>
      This document records and tracks all proposed engineering changes that 
      occur during development. An engineering change is a change proposed 
      or identified as desirable during one process that affects other work 
      products not part of the delivery of the current process. This document 
      tracks these proposed changes, their evaluation, analysis, and the 
      eventual resolution of these changes.

          <para>
            During Functional Specification, the <function>Obj</function> and <function>Fix</function>
            functions were discovered to have a number of missing or undesirable requirement 
            implications. The following changes are suggested:
          </para>
        </formalpara>
        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <simpara>
              Amend Requirement 16 to require only implementing the monadic interface of 
              the <function>⎕FIX</function> function.
            </simpara>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <simpara>
              An additional requirement should state that the <function>Obj</function> function 
              will produce a shared object in the given file name that has the same semantics 
              and function bindings as defined in the namespace.
            </simpara>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <simpara>
              Requirements should be added to clarify the error reporting in the case of files 
              that already exist when handling <function>Obj</function> output.
            </simpara>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
        <formalpara>
          <title>Analysis</title>
          <para>
            The above requirements do not change the semantics of the requirements, 
            and only refine them. They meet the intention of the project and should 
            be implemented. 
          </para>
        </formalpara>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <formalpara>
          <title>Description</title>
          <para>
            Functional specification revealed a possible ambiguity in the description of 
            requirement 21. Recommend the following:
          </para>
        </formalpara>
        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <simpara>
              That requirement 21 be changed to clearly indicate that only fully 
              closed namespaces are accepted; that is, only accept namespaces with 
              no free variable references.
            </simpara>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <simpara>
              Additionally, a new requirement 
              prohibiting the use of the <literal>⌶</literal>-beam should be included.
            </simpara>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <simpara>
              A new requirement prohibiting the use of the <function>⍎</function>
              function should be added. 
            </simpara>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <simpara>
              Requirement 4 should be amended to specify D-fns, rather than Co-Dfns 
              programs.
            </simpara>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <simpara>
              The new additions to the D-fns languages introduced by Co-Dfns should 
              be added and fully defined.
            </simpara>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <simpara>
              It should be remarked that no assignment which changes the overall 
              nameclass of a variable is allowed. 
            </simpara>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <simpara>
              A requirement detailing the unsupported operators should be added. 
              These operators include the <function>&amp;</function> operator as well as 
              the <function>⍠</function> operator.
            </simpara>

          <para>
            No semantic change is introduced based on the intention of the design, and 
            are at an early enough stage so as to not affect more than the functional 
            specification, so this should be implemented.
          </para>

        <formalpara>
          <title>Description</title>
          <para>
            The primary specification for the D-fns language appears in the Dyalog
            <citetitle>Programmer's Guide and Language Reference</citetitle>. This 
            should be explicitly marked as the reference document for the semantics of 
            the D-fns language.
          </para>
        </formalpara>
        <formalpara>
          <title>Analysis</title>
          <para>
            This clarifies a number of implied assumptions on the part of the specifications 
            and development plans, and should be included.
          </para>
        </formalpara>

      <listitem>
        <formalpara>

          <para>
            Clarify the exported functions that are produced by the compiler in the exported 
            namespace to indicate that currently, only global array variables and 
            functions will be exported. Operators and other such things will not. This 
            should be entered into the requirements document.
          </para>
        </formalpara>
        <formalpara>
          <title>Analysis</title>
          <para>
            This is a semantic change from the existing requirements, but does not affect 
            anything more than the functional specification, which has been amended to 
            include these adjustments anyways. Additionally, it does not add any 
            complexity, but simplifies the technical implemenation burden. The only visible 
            change to the user is the removal of operators from the public interface, which 
            is acceptable. 
          </para>
        </formalpara>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <formalpara>
          <title>Description</title>
          <para>
            Changes in the interface design are suggested by function specification. 
            It is unnecessary to have the object functionality separate from the fix 
            function. Additionally, analysis of the way that LLVM works indicates that 
            requirement #32 is not feasible, and will not be adequately implemented.
            A new requirement is suggested to indicate failures that may originate from 
            the LLVM Subsystem.
            This requires the following changes:
          </para>
        </formalpara>
        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <simpara>
              Change requirements 9, 16, 17, 18, 29, 30, 31, and 42 accordingly.
            </simpara>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <simpara>
              Eliminate requirements 19, 20, and 32.
            </simpara>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <simpara>
              Add a new requirement that states an LLVM error will signal an <literal>INTERNAL ERROR</literal>.
            </simpara>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
        <formalpara>
          <title>Analysis</title>
          <para>
            The change does not alter the functionality or intention of the compiler, but it 
            does create a simplified interface and is worth doing. It reduces workload later on.
          </para>
        </formalpara>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <formalpara>
          <title>Description</title>
          <para>
            An error in the declaration of an FFI function was discovered during certification.
            This must be adjusted before further certification can proceed.
          </para>
        </formalpara>

      <listitem>
        <formalpara>
          <title>Description</title>
          <para>
            The <function>ValidateInput</function> function is not defined. It should either be 
            defined or it should be replaced.
          </para>

      <listitem>

          <title>Description</title>
          <para>
            The <function>Tokenize</function> function gives a length error when trying to 
            split comments and code.
          </para>
        </formalpara>
        <formalpara>
          <title>Analysis</title>
          <para>
            The comment splitting code is the following line:
          </para>
        </formalpara>
        <programlisting>T C←⊂[0]↑2↑¨(1,¨1↓¨(~∨\¨0,¨1↓¨¯1⌽¨A)∧A←1↓¨'⍝'=A)⊂¨A</programlisting>
        <simpara>
          This code assumes that the array being scanned is always the same length as the 
          array itself. However, this is not the case when we deal with an empty array.
          The <literal>0,</literal> catenation will mean that we have an array of at least 
          length 1. In this case, the above expression will not work.
        </simpara>
        <simpara>
          This problem has wide ranging consequences because it is very likely that a given 
          namespace script will have blank lines in it, which will trigger this problem. 
          This function is overly complicated anyways, and can be simplified by a proper 
          use of the <literal>⍳</literal> function. We can use the following code instead:
        </simpara>
        <programlisting>I←(⊂A)⍳¨'⍝' ⋄ T←I↑¨A ⋄ C←I↓¨A</programlisting>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <formalpara>
          <title>Description</title>
          <para>
            The <function>Tokenize</function> function gives a malformed result.
          </para>

        <formalpara>
          <title>Analysis</title>
          <para>
            This is due to an unnecessarily complex set of code. It is difficult to 
            verify this code, and it should not have made it through. Replacing the 
            code with simpler code that can be proven should fix the malformation 
            result.
          </para>

            The code that finds the index incorrectly treats the non-scalar set of
