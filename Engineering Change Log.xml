    <title>Engineering Change Log</title>
    <simpara>
      This document records and tracks all proposed engineering changes that 
      occur during development. An engineering change is a change proposed 
      or identified as desirable during one process that affects other work 
      products not part of the delivery of the current process. This document 
      tracks these proposed changes, their evaluation, analysis, and the 
      eventual resolution of these changes.

          <para>
            During Functional Specification, the <function>Obj</function> and <function>Fix</function>
            functions were discovered to have a number of missing or undesirable requirement 
            implications. The following changes are suggested:

        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <simpara>
              Amend Requirement 16 to require only implementing the monadic interface of 
              the <function>⎕FIX</function> function.
            </simpara>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <simpara>
              An additional requirement should state that the <function>Obj</function> function 
              will produce a shared object in the given file name that has the same semantics 
              and function bindings as defined in the namespace.
            </simpara>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <simpara>
              Requirements should be added to clarify the error reporting in the case of files 
              that already exist when handling <function>Obj</function> output.
            </simpara>
          </listitem>

        <formalpara>
          <title>Analysis</title>
          <para>
            The above requirements do not change the semantics of the requirements, 
            and only refine them. They meet the intention of the project and should 
            be implemented. 
          </para>
        </formalpara>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <formalpara>
          <title>Description</title>
          <para>
            Functional specification revealed a possible ambiguity in the description of 
            requirement 21. Recommend that this requirement be changed to clearly 
            indicate that only fully closed namespaces. Additionally, a new requirement 
            prohibiting the use of the <literal>⌶</literal>-beam should be included.
          </para>
        </formalpara>
        <formalpara>
          <title>Analysis</title>
          <para>
            No semantic change is introduced based on the intention of the design, and 
            are at an early enough stage so as to not affect more than the functional 
            specification, so this should be implemented.
