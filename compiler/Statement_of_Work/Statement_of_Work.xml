    Implement, document, and publish an industrial-strength compiler for the 
    Co-Dfns language. This includes the publication of new research into 
    compiler technologies and formal software design. The intention of this 
    effort is to have a complete and solid foundation upon which to build 
    both a successful commercial enterprise and a solid and productive 
    research agenda.

    The Co-Dfns language is a simple extension of the D-fns language. It 
    implements two concepts on top of the existing language: parallel, 
    concurrent execution using the monadic operator <function>∥</function>, 
    which executes its argument concurrently and in parallel with the 
    code following it; and, the constant <constant>⌾</constant>, which 
    is an empty, single-assignment array. The fill element of a single 
    assignment array is a cell that blocks on all attempts to read from 
    it until there is a write to it. Only a single write is permitted 
    to a given cell.

    The completion of this project at the beginning of October is the 
    first version, implementing only the semantics and making only such 
    optimizations as are expedient. A future version is intended to 
    address the issues of performance to a greater degree.
