      During Functional Specification, the
      <function>Obj</function>
      and
      <function>Fix</function>
      functions were discovered to have a number of missing or undesirable
      requirement implications. The following changes are suggested:

  <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
      <simpara>
        Amend Requirement 16 to require only implementing the monadic interface
        of the
        <function>âŽ•FIX</function>
        function.
      </simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <simpara>
        An additional requirement should state that the
        <function>Obj</function>
        function will produce a shared object in the given file name that
        has the same semantics and function bindings as defined in the
        namespace.

    <listitem>
      <simpara>
        Requirements should be added to clarify the error reporting in
        the case of files that already exist when handling
        <function>Obj</function>
        output.

    <para>The above requirements do not change the semantics of the requirements,
    and only refine them. They meet the intention of the project and should
    be implemented.</para>
