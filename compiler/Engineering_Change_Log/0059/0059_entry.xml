    <title>Analysis</title>
    <para>
      There are some syntactic elements with handling the way that the
      <function>∇</function>
      is used, but in addition to this, the input received by
      <function>AnchorVars</function>
      isn't right at all. This is because
      <function>Parse</function>
      isn't doing its job at all. The issue is that we run the
      <function>ParseFuncExper</function>
      before we run the
      <function>ParseLineVar</function>
      which turns out to be a mistake. The
      <function>ParseFuncExpr</function>
      function doesn't try to consume all of the input, and thus it will
      take a single variable and parse it as a single function before ever
      seeing or realizing that we have anything more. In this case, the
      <function>ParseLinVar</function>
      will success strictly in cases where the
      <function>ParseFuncExper</function>
      will fail, but the
      <function>ParseFuncExper</function>
      might succeed where
      <function>ParseLineVar</function>
      might also succeed, so we should do the
      <function>ParseLineVar</function>
      first instead of last.
