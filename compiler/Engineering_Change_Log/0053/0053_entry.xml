      The
      <function>clean_env</function>
      is not declared in the module, giving a null return result that causes
      a crash when passed unchecked to the
      <function>BuildCall</function>
      function. We add a check to handle this null case so that it does
      not result in a crash. Additionally, we declare the clean_env function
      as a part of the runtime. Furthermore, an additional error in the
      way that the environments are cleaned up here is fixed, by ensuring
      that the size stored for the environment is actually a value reference,
      and not an APL value.
