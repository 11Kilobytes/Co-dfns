      The <function>FlattenExprs</function> had a number of issues with 
      the <function>lft</function> helper. Firstly, it was called on 
      scope root expressions, while its semantics was only for inner 
      expression nodes that are not already at the scope root. Additionally, 
      there was a type error which resulted in empty node elements appearing 
      in the result code.
