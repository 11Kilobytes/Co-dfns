    <title>Analysis: Language Reference</title>
    <simpara>
      In general, most of the information that can be gleaned from
      the Language Reference is embedded in the <citetitle>Function
      Specification</citetitle> or some other element, including the
      prototypes. However, the language reference remains the only
      place to get a clear view of the semantics of each individual
      primitive, and it generally does a good job of defining this
      behavior. It also is the place to locate the information about
      how promotion works in detail, which is outside of the scope
      of detail in the <citetitle>Function
      Specification</citetitle>. While little can be extracted from
      the reference, it should be used as the means to define the
      behaviors of some of the more detailed elements of the runtime
      system when that time comes.
