    <simpara>
      The following are the requirements that were derived from the sequence
      enumeration. They will be merged into the
      <citetitle>Software Requirements</citetitle>
      at the end of specification.

          The namespace returned by
          <function>CoDfns.Fix</function>
          should allow both calling of the functions defined in the given
          namespace script as well as rebinding them to names outside of
          the namespace in a manner consistent with normally fixed namespaces.

          Attempting to access a variable in the namespace returned by

          by
          <function>CoDfns.Fix</function>
          should result in the same error as would have been produced by
          giving the same input to the namespace returned by the
          <function>âŽ•FIX</function>
          function on the same namespace script.
