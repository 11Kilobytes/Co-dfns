    <title>Specification Functions</title>
    <simpara>The specifications that we will use are based directly off
    of the properties that are used above. This is because these functions
    and properties are of specific but limited use going forward. The main
    use they have is to collapse the prior effort into a stimuli oriented
    table, rather than a sequence oriented table, and to flatten out the
    recursions so that it is not necessary to have the recursive stimuli
    in the black box specification.</simpara>
    <simpara>An intential reduction in the precision is given here by omitting
    the definitions of the specification functions. Normally, this would
    signal a serious problem given the nature of the state-box specification.
    However, since we are not going to be using a state-box specification
    in the normal fashion, we will not be losing much here, and we will
    encode the appropriate behaviors through recursion in the clear-box
    development.</simpara>
    <simpara>Additionally, there is an implicit possibility for each of
    the specification functions to have no readily useful value in some
    of the contexts, so we will just omit their mention when the contribute
    nothing to the specification.</simpara>
    <simpara>
      There is one additional specification function that is not defined
      by the properties above. The
      <function>Context</function>
      specification function gives a set of possible recursive stimuli
      that are accepted at this point, indicating the contexts that could
      be used. This return of a set of values instead of a single value
      distinguishes it slightly from the other functions, which return
      only single states.
