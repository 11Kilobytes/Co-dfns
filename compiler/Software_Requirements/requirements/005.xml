  <simpara>All valid D-fns programs should be valid Co-Dfns programs unless
  they have a programming error that the compiler can catch that the interpreter
  cannot catch until runtime. In other words, a valid D-fns program is
  one that runs without unintended error as well as just parsing correctly.</simpara>
