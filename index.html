<p>Welcome to the Co-dfns compiler project.
The Co-dfns project aims to provide a high-performance,
high-reliability compiler for a parallel extension of the Dyalog dfns
programming language.  The dfns language is a functionally oriented,
lexically scoped dialect of APL. The Co-dfns language extends the
dfns language to include explicit task parallelism with implicit
structures for synchronization and determinism. The language is
designed to enable rigorous formal analysis of programs to aid in
compiler optimization and programmer productivity, as well as in the
general reliability of the code itself.</p>

<p>Our mission is to deliver scalable APL programming to information and 
domain experts across many fields, expanding the scope and capabilities 
of what you can effectively accomplish with APL.</p>

<p>If you would like to support this project, please consider a small commitment 
in gratitude through <a href="https://gratipay.com/arcfide">Gratipay</a>. This is one of 
the best ways you can help ensure Co-dfns continues to improve. </p>

<p>If you are a commercial enterprise and do not wish or cannot use Gratipay, 
but still wish to assist the project, contact Morten Kromberg of Dyalog, Ltd. 
via email (<a href="mailto:mkrom@dyalog.com">mkrom@dyalog.com</a>) to discuss other funding and support options.</p>
