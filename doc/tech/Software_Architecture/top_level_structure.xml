  <title>Top-level Structure</title>
  <simpara>
    This section details the refinement of the <citetitle>Function
    Specification</citetitle> into a suitable design at the top
    level. We divide this operation into a series of passes, and
    then detail the behavior of these passes and how they need to be
    used. This includes a complete specification of the AST to be
    used in the compiler as well as the black-box view of each pass.
