    This document records and tracks all proposed engineering changes that 
    occur during development. An engineering change is a change proposed 
    or identified as desirable during one process that affects other work 
    products not part of the delivery of the current process. This document 
    tracks these proposed changes, their evaluation, analysis, and the 
    eventual resolution of these changes.
