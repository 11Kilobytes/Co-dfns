    <para>
      There are calls to foreign functions that could be dangerous and result 
      in a segmentation fault or the like. We should defensively program 
      against these to make sure that we signal an appropriate error instead 
      of getting the segmentation fault.

      This occurs almost entirely in the <function>GenLLVM</function> pass 
      and can be done most of the time by a check against a null pointer.
