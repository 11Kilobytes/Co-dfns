      The current statistical testing framework takes too much time to run and 
      use, though it doesn't take that much time to generate the tests. We should 
      automate the effort to run the statistical tests in such a way that they 
      get good results and can get proper testing feedback.

      Gianfranco's APLUnit system should work for doing these automated tests. 
      We should split out each statistical test case into its own file and do 
      all the appropriate testing that we need to do from in there. This 
      should also include a conversion of all the previous testing efforts into 
      this framework to double check and to unify the framework.
