      The output of
      <function>ErrorMessage</function>
      does not seem to work right in that it gives only a single character
      response.

    <para>
      This is due to a misunderstanding in the way that the
      <function>cstring</function>
      function works. The function will actually return a vector of the
      characters in the string, rather than a single one element vector
      containing said string. This is an easy fix to apply.
