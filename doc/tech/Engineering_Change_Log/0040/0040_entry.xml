      In the call to
      <function>ParseNamedBnd</function>
      in
      <function>ParseLineVar[62]</function>
      , the call returns with a syntax error. Here are some important data

    <title>Analysis</title>
    <para>
      When dealing with a nested set of assignments
      <literal>Vu ← Vfo ← Vu ← Fe</literal>
      , the
      <function>ParseLineVar</function>
      function should keep track of the nameclass of the assignment. However,
      in the current code, it does not. Instead, it will only pass the
      correct type class value to
      <function>ParseNamedBnd</function>
      if it was the last seen variable. In other words, we do not ensure
      that all three values match class, and not just the most recently
      seen. Fixing this in the full will require threading the type class
      back through the set of recursive calls to
      <function>ParseLineVar</function>
      , but the current work around is to always pass a type of 2, since
      we know that this will be the only type that we support at the moment.
