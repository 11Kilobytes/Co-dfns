    <para>
      There was a missing runtime function <function>array_mt()</function>
      that was not implemented. In fact, this function does not need to 
      exist. The fix is to use the <function>array_free()</function> 
      which is more or less functionally equivalent. An update to the 
      <citetitle>Software Architecture</citetitle> clarifies exactly what 
      this does when used in the context of an empty return. Additionally, 
      more safeguards are put into place in the code to generate system 
      errors when these sort of behavior occurs.
