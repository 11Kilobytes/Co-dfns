    <para>
      The
      <citetitle>Increment Construction Plan</citetitle>
      details that shy results should happen around Increment 7. However,
      a reasonable semantics should exist for shy results before that.
      In particular, shy results should just return as regular results,
      rather than returning nothing at all. Currently, the situation is
      even worse, because the compiler incorrectly generates an empty body,
      which is not permitted in the LLVM IR.
    </para>
  </formalpara>
  <para>To improve this situation, we should adapt the compiler so that
  shy results are at the very least returned, rather than discarded. We
  should also ensure that we do not have an empty body as we currently
  do in the IR.</para>
