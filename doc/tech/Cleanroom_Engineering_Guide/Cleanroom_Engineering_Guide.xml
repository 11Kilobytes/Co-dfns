    This document describes the tailored Cleanroom process to develop 
    the Co-dfns compiler. The current limited manpower for the project 
    drives most of these adaptations. This scales down a number of 
    processes since other processes exist in their place and do not 
    contribute to the primary development team.

  <simpara>
    The descriptions, enumerations, and organization of these processes is 
    taken directly from <citetitle>The Cleanroom Reference Model</citetitle> 
    as found in <citetitle>Cleanroom Software Engineering</citetitle> by 
    Prowell, et al. but have been adapted to fit this project. Since 
    not everyone is expected to have a copy of this book, this guide 
    attempts to explicate as far as possible the specific process details 
    for successful execution, but it does not attempt to replace the 
    above reference for an understanding of Cleanroom Software Engineering 
    in general.
