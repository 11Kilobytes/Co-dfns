    This document describes the tailored Cleanroom process to be used in the 
    development of the Co-Dfns compiler. The process described here is 
    driven primarily by a need to adapt the Cleanroom Process to the use of 
    a single member team with only minimal support from a few other assets. 
    This requires that a number of processes are scaled down and that 
    certain other measures are in place to assure a high degree of 
    performance.

    Normally this document would also include specific details about 
    environment and tools in use, but this is not necessary for the team 
    size.

    The descriptions, enumerations, and organization of these processes is 
    taken directly from <citetitle>The Cleanroom Reference Model</citetitle> 
    as found in <citetitle>Cleanroom Software Engineering</citetitle> by 
    Prowell, et al. but have been adapted to fit this project. For 
    definitions of work products and the entry exit expectations of 
    processes, as well as other normal operating procedures, the above 
    references constitute the norm. On occassion, some work products may 
    not contain all standard content, as this content is not relevant to 
    this project. Most, if not all, of these omissions are on the basis 
    of minimal management processes, accounting for a single developer 
    environment.
