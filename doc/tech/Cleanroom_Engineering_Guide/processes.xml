  <simpara>
    The following is an overview of all the Cleanroom Processes used in 
    this project, including a short summary of their function and the work 
    products that they produce.

    <title>Omitted Processes and Alternative Implementations</title>
    <simpara>
      No specification, development, or certification processes were 
      omitted from the above list as these are judged to be critical 
      steps in the quality control of the development cycle. However, 
      a number of management processes were eliminated as being too heavy 
      for a single man development team.

      The performance improvement process is eliminated in favor of ad 
      hoc improvement throughout the process, which is judged more 
      efficient than a complete process for the same. The Project 
      Management process is not entirely eliminated, but is reduced to 
      a single step occuring at process transitions to update and maintain 
      the <citetitle>Project Record</citetitle>.

      The Architecture Specification can be conducted either as a single 
      process or as a combined part of the work with the Increment 
      Design. That is, the cycle of Increment design can explicitly feed 
      back into the Architecture Design.
