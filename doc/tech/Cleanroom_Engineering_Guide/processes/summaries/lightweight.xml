  <title>Lightweight Management Process</title>
  <para>
    Because of the size of the team and because of external management 
    entities that are not involved in the Cleanroom processes, the project 
    requires only lightweight management as a part of the Cleanroom 
    process. Specifically, the team can update the 
    <citetitle>Project Record</citetitle> at each transition of processes with 
    the appropriate information, without requiring explicit management 
    decisions, which will be handled outside of the Cleanroom processes.
