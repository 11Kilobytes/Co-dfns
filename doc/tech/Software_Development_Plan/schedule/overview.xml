      The main deadline in this project is the October conference. To meet 
      this deadline, the final product needs to be completed by the 1st of 
      the same month. A good deal of existing code and research is 
      already in place, but these will be reused as part of the 
      reengineering effort. The key component is the architecture 
      specification, which will need more time than normal, and more 
      rigorous specification as prototypes indicate that the main details 
      of program behavior are contained in the pass decomposition. As the 
      external behavior is less complicated, more resources must be 
      allocated to a clear architecture to decompose the problem further.

      There is a planned productivity hit during the weeks of July 15th 
      to the 26th, to account for an educational program. This is the 
      time for allocating the least intensive pieces, where increment 
      planning, and other high-level specifications can happen, since 
      some of that burden is off-loaded onto the Architecture 
      Specification.
