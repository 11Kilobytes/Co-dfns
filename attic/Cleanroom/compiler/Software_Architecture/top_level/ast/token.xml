    <title>Element: Token</title>
    <simpara>
      The <varname>Token</varname> element is a body-less element
      that represents a single token which is a symbol or element
      in the tokenizer that does not or need not appear in the
      final AST because it is subsumed by the structured nature of
      the document. In other words, it represents some character
      or element in the serialization of the syntax that controls
      the structure of the code.

      <para>
        The <varname>Token</varname> element does not contain any
        body elements and should be empty.

      <title>Token attributes</title>
      <para>
        The <parameter>name</parameter> attribute is the value of the token, or indicates the
        literal token value. The <parameter>class</parameter> indicates the kind of token
        which it is, this would be one of the following:
        <simplelist type="inline">
          <member><literal>delimiter</literal></member>
          <member><literal>separator</literal></member>
          <member><literal>function</literal></member>
          </simplelist>.  The last member,
          <literal>function</literal>, indicates that the token is
          a part of the function notation. The
          <literal>delimiter</literal> class contains all of the
          tokens that are paired up with one another in one form
          or another. The <literal>sepraator</literal> class
          indicates those tokens that are used to separate strings
          or arrays of things, which can be repeated more than
          once between more than two items if need be. This would
          include things like the statement separator and the
          index axis separator, the semi-colon.
