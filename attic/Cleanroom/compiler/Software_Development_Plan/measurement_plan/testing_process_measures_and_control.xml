    <title>Testing Process Measures and Control</title>
    <simpara>
      In addition to the certification record, the testing process must 
      record the iterations between testing, the changes in system 
      reliability and MTTF, and the relative improvement of each version 
      of the software both from increment to increment as well as between 
      engineering changes within the increment. The number of faults 
      discovered during the process should be tracked and monitered for 
      signs that the development process is not producing software of 
      the appropriate quality.

      Development should not progress to the next increment until the 
      current increment under testing is certified to appropriate levels. 
      Moreover, of testing encounters a failure it should immediately 
      initiate an engineering change and the fault should be addressed. 
      Once the fault has been confirmed to be removed, the entire 
      expirement must be run from the beginning on the new version of 
      the software.
