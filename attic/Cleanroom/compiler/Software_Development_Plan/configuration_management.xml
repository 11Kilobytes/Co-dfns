    <title>Configuration Management</title>
    <simpara>
      Git and GitHub.com will be the primary hosting for the configuration management.
      Each increment should receive its own tag on master.
      Primary development will occur on the master branch. Commits should 
      maintain code correctness, but there are expected to be more commits than 
      just a single commit per increment. All source and work products will be 
      kept under configuration management through Git. Commits to the 
      master should be small and obviously correct.

      Documentation will be maintained in the source tree through the use of 
      DocBook v5 files. Their configurations and stylesheets should also be kept 
      in source if they differ from the standard, openly available stylesheets.
      The built-in Wiki of GitHub will not be used for programmer level 
      documentation, but will be used as the website and front facing content 
      delivery platform. Likewise, the ticket system should be used as a 
      customer interaction vehicle, and not as a means of tracking errors 
      uncovered during the development of the software. These other errors will 
      be kept in the appropriate journals and work products specified in the 
      <citetitle>Cleanroom Engineering Guide</citetitle>.

    <simpara>
      Public facing information and details can be kept on the GitHub wiki. User 
      comments are to be funneled through the ticket system. The community should 
      be able to update the Wiki as a vehicle of contribution and ideas.
