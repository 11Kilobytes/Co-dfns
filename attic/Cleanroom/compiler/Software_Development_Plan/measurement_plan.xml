  <title>Measurement Plan</title>
  <simpara>
    The following sections define a plan for statistical quality control 
    and measures of product readiness. They include the goals for 
    software certification together with the defined metrics for measuring 
    product and process quality. They define the process requirements to 
    assure that the certification process accurately certifies the quality 
    of the software and that the process can be evaluated for quality 
    assessment.
