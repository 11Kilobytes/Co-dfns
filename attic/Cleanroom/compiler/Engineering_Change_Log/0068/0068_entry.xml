    <para>
      A number of people have complained of the length of the files. While 
      this does not appear to be a problem with appropriate competency in 
      your text editor, if one wishes to use a myriad of editors, this can 
      present a problem. Moreover, it can make scanning and understanding 
      the documents at a glance without the aid of a structural editor 
      difficult.

    <para>
      Understanding these issues, it has been decided to begin splitting out the 
      code into multiple files to make editing easier. This does not mean that 
      the deliverable work products will be split out, but simply that they 
      will not require editing a single very large file. instead, files will be 
      kept small, and larger structural natures reveiled in the filesystem 
      organization.
