    <para>
      When parsing each token of an expression string, it's possible that 
      we can try to parse a function, but that function is syntactically 
      invalid. This needs to be thrown back up when it is encountered. 
      Thus, when we check on the type of the node, if we do not have one of 
      the types of the node that we expect, this means that the parsing 
      of the function node should have succeeded, but it did not, which 
      implies an error that we should throw at this point.
