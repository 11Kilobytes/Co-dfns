    <title>Description</title>
    <para>Morten Kromberg has suggested that we do not need to follow the
    standard APL behavior when handling the Fnf behavior, and we can instead
    follow the method that we see in most other compilers. That is, we
    can just overwrite the existing file rather than signalling an error.</para>

    <title>Analysis</title>
    <para>
      This will require a small change in the Function Specification to
      handle things, which will require changing the enumeration and subsequently
      the Black Box Definitions. This will also require some code changes
      in the
      <filename>CoDfns.dyalog</filename>
      namespace script. Current Usage Specification does not need to be
      changed, and the main models for Increment 3 can be adjusted to handle
      this change. Previous increments did not or were not sensitive to
      this change and do not need to be recertified.
