    <title>Description</title>
    <para>Changes in the interface design are suggested by function specification.
    It is unnecessary to have the object functionality separate from the
    fix function. Additionally, analysis of the way that LLVM works indicates
    that requirement #32 is not feasible, and will not be adequately implemented.
    A new requirement is suggested to indicate failures that may originate
    from the LLVM Subsystem. This requires the following changes:</para>

  <orderedlist>

      <simpara>Change requirements 9, 16, 17, 18, 29, 30, 31, and 42 accordingly.</simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <simpara>Eliminate requirements 19, 20, and 32.</simpara>
    </listitem>

      <simpara>
        Add a new requirement that states an LLVM error will signal an
        <literal>INTERNAL ERROR</literal>
        .

    <title>Analysis</title>
    <para>The change does not alter the functionality or intention of the
    compiler, but it does create a simplified interface and is worth doing.
    It reduces workload later on.</para>
