    <para>
      When parsing a condition, such as
      <literal>{ V3← 99 : 24 ⋄ }</literal>
      , the
      <classname>Condition</classname>
      node will not have any children, because the children are put at
      a depth one higher than they should be.

    <para>
      In the
      <function>ParseCond</function>
      function, the two calls to
      <function>ParseExpr</function>
      will return nodes assumed to be at the same depth as the condition
      node, since the tokens are at the same depth. Since there is actually
      an additional nesting level, we need to put the (potentially) two
      nodes as children by increasing each of their depths by one.
