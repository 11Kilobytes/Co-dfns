      The <varname>f</varname> mask contains only those scopes 
      indicated by <classname>Function</classname> nodes. However, 
      in the calculation of the scopes, we also include the root 
      node as a scope. This means that there is an off by one error 
      here. To fix this, we can simply use the <varname>rf</varname>
      mask, which includes the root node.
