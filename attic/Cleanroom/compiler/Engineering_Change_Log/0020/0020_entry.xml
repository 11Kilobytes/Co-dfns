      The
      <constant>Fnd</constant>
      and
      <constant>Fnm</constant>
      stimuli do not have any real purpose in the top-level enumeration
      and are redundant, they should be removed from the stimuli set.

      This redundancy is demonstrated by the fact that these stimuli do
      not show up in the Canonical sequences at all, as well as being subsumed
      in all cases by the
      <constant>Fe</constant>
      stimuli, which itself has direct support for the
      <constant>Fnd</constant>
      and
      <constant>Fnm</constant>
      stimuli. This change has minimal impact on the rest of the system,
      as they are not mentioned directly anywhere else, and are already
      subsumed in the rest of the documentation. Thus, it is safe to remove
      them at any time.
