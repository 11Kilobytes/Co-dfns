        Create the usage models to be used for software testing and 
        certification. Express the model in terms of the probabilities
        of inputs. Develop the models to satisfy objectives such as 
        certification for expected operational use or certification of 
        infrequently used functions with high consequences of failure. 
        Employ usage model statistics to provide insight into system 
        complexity and the testing effort required to meet quality 
        objectives. Develop a statistical test plan, prepare the test 
        environment, and generate the statistical test cases.

        Demonstrate the fitness for use of the software in a formal 
        statistical expirement. Execute statistical test cases under 
        expiremental controf, evaluate results, and initiate 
        engineering change activity if failures are encountered. 
        Compare the values of certification measures obtained in 
        statistical testing with certification goals to assess the 
        software's fitness for use. Compare measures of testing 
        progress to process control standards to assess the 
        likelihood of reaching certification goals with planned 
        schedules and resources.
