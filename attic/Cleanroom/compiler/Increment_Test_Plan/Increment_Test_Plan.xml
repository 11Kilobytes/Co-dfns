    This document details the overall approach to testing, and
    provides documentation and insight into the structure and proper
    use of the other work products developed during Usage Modeling
    and Test Planning, namely, the <citetitle>Usage
    Models</citetitle> and <citetitle>Statistical Test
    Cases</citetitle>. This includes important details like how to
    run the tests, how the tests will be measured, as well as the
    order in which testing should be conducted. It does not include
    the actual usage models or test cases, but covers everything
    else created or designed during the Usage Modeling and Test
    Planning process.
