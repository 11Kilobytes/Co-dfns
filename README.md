# Co-dfns Compiler

The Co-dfns project aims to provide a high-performance, high-reliability
compiler for a parallel extension of the Dyalog dfns programming language.
The dfns language is a functionally oriented, lexically scoped dialect of
APL. The Co-dfns language extends the dfns language to include explicit task
parallelism with implicit structures for synchronization and determinism. 
The language is designed to enable rigorous formal analysis of programs 
to aid in compiler optimization and programmer productivity, as well as in
the general reliability of the code itself.

Our mission is to deliver scalable APL programming to information and domain
experts across many fields, expanding the scope and capabilities of what
you can effectively accomplish with APL.

## Contributing and Helping

We are seeking to create an open funding model for Co-dfns research through 
user and patron contributions. You can support the project by contributing code, feedback, benchmarks, and so forth, but you can also directly support the Co-dfns project by funding the author:
