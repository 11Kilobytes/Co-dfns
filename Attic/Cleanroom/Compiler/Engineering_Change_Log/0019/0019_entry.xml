    <title>Description</title>
    <para>In the LLVM output, the V9 rank is 1, rather than 0, and the
    shape contains a one element vector containing 1. This is incorrect
    for a single scalar value.</para>

    <title>Analysis</title>
    <para>
      The coding of the
      <function>GenConst</function>
      function is not sufficiently robust and requires reworking. In particular,
      the initial extraction of the expression values did not take into
      account the appropriate shape of the expression. These effects are
      localized and contained to the
      <function>GenConst</function>
      function, and do not affect any other elements or problems.
    </para>
  </formalpara>
  <simpara>
    The cause of this problem can be traced at least partially back to
    having a function specification that is unable to express these precise
    details about the nature of each conversion. Adapting the function
    specification to include more information like this would like improve
    the ability to catch these errors earlier. Technically, however, these
    elements are clearly specified in the
    <citetitle>Programming Language Reference</citetitle>
    from Dyalog.
