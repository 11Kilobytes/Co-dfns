    <title>Description</title>
    <para>Clarify the exported functions that are produced by the compiler
    in the exported namespace to indicate that currently, only global array
    variables and functions will be exported. Operators and other such
    things will not. This should be entered into the requirements document.</para>

    <title>Analysis</title>
    <para>This is a semantic change from the existing requirements, but
    does not affect anything more than the functional specification, which
    has been amended to include these adjustments anyways. Additionally,
    it does not add any complexity, but simplifies the technical implemenation
    burden. The only visible change to the user is the removal of operators
    from the public interface, which is acceptable.</para>
