    <title>Element: Function</title>
    <simpara>
      The <varname>Function</varname> element encapsulates
      user-defined functions and operators. It consists of a body
      of expressions and bindings to functions.

      <title>Function content</title>
      <para>
        The <varname>Function</varname> body contains zero or more of the following:
        <simplelist type="inline">
          <member><varname>Expression</varname></member>
          <member><varname>FuncExpr</varname></member>
          <member><varname>Condition</varname></member>
          <member><varname>Guard</varname></member>
          </simplelist>.
          They may appear in any order and in any number.
      </para>
    </formalpara>
    <formalpara>
      <title>Function attributes</title>
      <para>
        The <parameter>name</parameter> attribute is the same as in
        the <varname>Expression</varname> element, containing one
        or more names separate by spaces to indicate the names
        that are given to this function.
        The <parameter>class</parameter> attribute gives the type of the function,
        which is one of the following:
        <simplelist type="inline">
          <member>ambivalent</member>
          <member>monadic</member>
          <member>dyadic</member> </simplelist>.
	    These correspond
	    directly to the three classes of Fn stimuli that we have
	    in our <citetitle>Function Specification</citetitle>.
	    We also have the <parameter>comment</parameter>
	    attribute which should appear if there is a comment on
	    the same line as the first line of the definition of a
	    function that has no expression or other body element on
	    it.
	    The <parameter>alloca</parameter> attribute indicates the
	    number of slots needed to allocate space for the local scope
	    of the function.
	    The <parameter>depth</parameter> attribute indicates the
	    depth of the function's definition, determining the number of
	    environments it may reference.
      </para>
