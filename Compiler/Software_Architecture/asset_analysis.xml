  <title>Asset Analysis</title>
  <simpara>
    The <citetitle>Software Development Plan</citetitle> identifies
    four to five major influences on the Software architecture:
    LLVM, MiniKanren, Nanopass, and prototypes implemented in C,
    C++, and Dyalog APL. MiniKanren is a specific implementation
    suggestion for a specific component of the compiler, and as such
    plays a less significant role in the Software Architecture. The
    other components, however, play a very significant role in the
    design of the software, and this section documents the analysis
    of these elements as they relate to the design of the
    system. There is a sub-section dedicated to each of these assets
    as well as specific sections to deal with analysis of the
    <citetitle>Function Specification</citetitle> and other
    miscellaneous assets.
