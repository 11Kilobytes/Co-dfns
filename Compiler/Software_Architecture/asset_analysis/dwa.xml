    <title>Analysis: DWA</title>
    <simpara>
      The DWA system from Dyalog allows for minimal overhead functions 
      to be created by sharing data structures. This will require 
      some important considerations when dealing with the array representations
      used by the Co-dfns compiler.

          The DWA system should be used for handling inter-system communication 
          between the interpreter and the compiler, and this will in turn 
          inform the runtime design of the system.
