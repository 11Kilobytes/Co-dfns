    The compiler should support as valid source input a new monadic operator
    <function>∥</function>
    that is called the
    <firstterm>Par</firstterm>
    operator. This operator expects to receive a function as its left operand
    and returns a function which behaves in the exact same was as the function
    given by the left operand except that the value returned is a single-assignment
    array instead of a normal mutable array. The returned function will
    return immediately, queuing the left operand function to run concurrently.
    The single assignment array returned is assumed to be equivalent in
    the sense of
    <function>≡</function>
    to the value returned by the left operand when applied with the same
    arguments. The single assignment array will be considered to have a
    pending write operation queued based on the concurrently executing
    left operand. When the queued left operand application finishes executing,
    then at some point after this the data of that operand will be available
    as the single-assignment array. Until then the single-assignment array
    will be considered unassigned.
