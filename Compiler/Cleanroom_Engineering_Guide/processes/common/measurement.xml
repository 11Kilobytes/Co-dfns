      <para>
        Measure the effectiveness of a review in terms of percentage of all 
        defects originating prior to the review that are found in the review. 
        These percentages are determined, of course, after execution testing.

      <para>
        Measure the quality of work products that define the software in terms 
        of the percentage of execution failures that are traced to defects in 
        the work products. These percentages are determined, of course, 
        after execution testing.
