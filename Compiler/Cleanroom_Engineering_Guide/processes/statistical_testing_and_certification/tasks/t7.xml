        <title>Decide whether to stop testing</title>
        <para>
          Positive case: Testing can be stopped and the software 
          certified as fit for use if the current values of the certification
          measures satisfy certification goals and if no failures have 
          been observed during testing of the current software version 
          (or none worth the cost and risk of correction).
        </para>
      </formalpara>
      <para>
        Negative case: Testing should be stopped and the software
        reengineered and reverified if process control standards have
        been violated. Violation of process control standards occurs
        when certification goals cannot be achieved given current
        values of the certification measures and the remaining
        schedule and resources for testing.
