  <title>DropUnreached Enumeration</title>
  <para>
     The <function>DropUnreached</function> component syntactically unreachable 
     code. It's fairly simple to handle if we make some space for creative 
     interpretations of our stimuli stream. In this case, we assume that the 
     stream continues on its merry way except when we encounter a function body, 
     and in that case, our stream starts. We assume an independent stream for 
     each function body, and rely on our architecture to handle extracting and 
     saving those streams.
