  <title>DropUnnamed Enumeration</title>
  <para>
     The <function>DropUnnamed</function> component handles taking the 
     parsed AST and eliminating obviously irrelevant points from the top-level 
     of the code to avoid dealing with them. It's fairly easy to handle, and we 
     don't need very complicated traversals. It is assumed that the stimuli come 
     in a pre-order depth-first order over the AST.
