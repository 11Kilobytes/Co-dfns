  <title>Drop Unreached</title>
  <para>
    The <function>DropUnreached</function> component takes in the AST delivered by 
    <function>DropUnnamed</function> and eliminates any expressions inside of the 
    body of functions which are syntactically unreachable. This means any expressions 
    which are after a returning expression, which is any expression that is not 
    named at the root of the function body. This component runs on the body of 
    each function definition.

    The set of responses is fairly simple here. We do not do anything to the 
    stream except to keep it or drop the node, and in either case we need to 
    consider the children in the expression.
