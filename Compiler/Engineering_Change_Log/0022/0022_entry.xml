    <title>Description</title>
    <para>
      There is little support for the
      <type>uint4_t</type>
      in compilers, so we should remove its use from the array and the
      compiler output. This will simplify the definition of the compiler
      in the shared object runtime. This will fix the compiler failure
      in building this shared object.

    <para>
      This will require some changes to the
      <citetitle>Software Architecture</citetitle>
      and subsequently to the
      <filename>CoDfns.dyalog</filename>
      namespace, which will have to adjust its use of the int4 type in
      various places. Other than this, it is not used elsewhere and will
      not affect other documents.
