      We get a domain error in

      when trying to handle an empty namespace.

    <para>
      The
      <function>DropUnmd</function>
      function is called in the compiler right after the
      <function>KillLines</function>
      function. In the case of an empty namespace, this will result in
      a tree with no depth-1 subtrees. This will result in attempting to
      execute a first-axis catenate against an empty array with no identity
      element by default.
    </para>
  </formalpara>
  <para>The appropriate fix is to ensure that the catenation never receives
  and empty vector of sub-trees. We manually insert an empty AST node to
  the head of the vector coming in, which will ensure a non-zero vector,
  but will not affect the results of any of the catenations in the line.</para>
