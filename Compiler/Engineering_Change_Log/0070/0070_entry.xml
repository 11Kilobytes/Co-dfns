      The current verification isn't working very well, as there are too many small 
      details that aren't getting handled. This is partly because it's not very easy 
      for a single person to do verification on their own code. We really need two 
      people to do that. On the other hand, examining the set of errors that seem 
      to occur, it would be easier for an automated system to verify these problems, 
      and that would probably improve the reliability of the verification process. 
      This is especially true given that only a single user is developing this stuff 
      right now.

      This could definitely be done, but what the best means to do it remains a little 
      unknown. I recommend that the first effort should be a new implementation of 
      APL primitives which operate over abstract array descriptions rather than on 
      their data. This should allow for a form of abstract interpretation that 
      will deliver the appropriate level of rigor to eliminate the majority of the 
      errors that occur while doing the program design.
