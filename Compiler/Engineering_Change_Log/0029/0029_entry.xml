      Adapt the handling of the Generation of multi-named functions during
      the
      <function>GenLLVM</function>
      pass to handle the multiple names, which currently it fails with
      a
      <symbol>VALUE ERROR</symbol>
      .

    <para>
      The cause of this problem is that we had a shy result being returned
      by the
      <function>GenFunc</function>
      function, which apparently does not work well in places where a normal
      value is expected. This appeared to work during our initial investigations,
      but removing the shy value fixes this problem. Some investigation
      is worthwhile, so this is being sent to Dyalog to understand better
      why this error occurs.
