    <para>
      After spending some thorough experimentation with this, the root
      of the problem is a clear issue with the way that dfns appear to
      interact with the
      <literal>‚çé</literal>
      (Execute) function. It is not clear why this is happening, or how
      to fix it yet. The issue is currently being farmed out to Dyalog
      to identify what the core issue could be.
    </para>
  </formalpara>
  <simpara>To allow for further testing, it was decided to abandon the
  Namespace generation until further information from Dyalog arrives. Statistical
  testing will take place without the namespace generation aspect.</simpara>
