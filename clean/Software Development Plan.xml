      <title>Mission</title>
      <simpara>
        This project has two main goals. The first is to produce a workable 
        compiler that can be demonstrated to Dyalog customers later this year. 
        The second is to prepare a framework for future compiler development and 
        research.

      <title>Work Products</title>
      <simpara>
        The following work products will be created during the course of this 
        project. Some of them will be useful to the end-user, and others are 
        only of interest for continued maintenance and development of the 
        system.

              Each increment is turned into an executable form during 
              certification and testing. The final increment forms the 
              completed software system in executable form for the end-user.

              Not part of the development cycle, at the completion of the 
              final certification phase, the development work products are 
              accumulated into an useful reference manual for the user of 
              the <citetitle>executable system</citetitle>. This may be 
              maintained as a part of the 
              <citetitle>Executable System</citetitle>.
