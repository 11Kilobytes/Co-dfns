{"name":"Co-dfns","tagline":"High-performance, Reliable, and Parallel APL","body":"# Co-dfns Compiler\r\n\r\nThe Co-dfns project aims to provide a high-performance,\r\nhigh-reliability compiler for a parallel extension of the Dyalog dfns\r\nprogramming language.  The dfns language is a functionally oriented,\r\nlexically scoped dialect of APL. The Co-dfns language extends the\r\ndfns language to include explicit task parallelism with implicit\r\nstructures for synchronization and determinism. The language is\r\ndesigned to enable rigorous formal analysis of programs to aid in\r\ncompiler optimization and programmer productivity, as well as in the\r\ngeneral reliability of the code itself.\r\n\r\nOur mission is to deliver scalable APL programming to information and \r\ndomain experts across many fields, expanding the scope and capabilities \r\nof what you can effectively accomplish with APL.\r\n\r\n## Supporting the Project\r\n\r\nWe need your help! Please contact <arcfide@sacrideo.us> to learn how you can \r\nsupport the project.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
