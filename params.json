{"name":"Co-dfns","tagline":"High-performance, Reliable, and Parallel APL","body":"# Co-dfns Compiler\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Co-dfns compiler project.\r\nThe Co-dfns project aims to provide a high-performance,\r\nhigh-reliability compiler for a parallel extension of the Dyalog dfns\r\nprogramming language.  The dfns language is a functionally oriented,\r\nlexically scoped dialect of APL. The Co-dfns language extends the\r\ndfns language to include explicit task parallelism with implicit\r\nstructures for synchronization and determinism. The language is\r\ndesigned to enable rigorous formal analysis of programs to aid in\r\ncompiler optimization and programmer productivity, as well as in the\r\ngeneral reliability of the code itself.\r\n\r\nOur mission is to deliver scalable APL programming to information and \r\ndomain experts across many fields, expanding the scope and capabilities \r\nof what you can effectively accomplish with APL.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to support this project, please consider a small commitment \r\nin gratitude through [Gratipay](https://gratipay.com/arcfide). This is one of \r\nthe best ways you can help ensure Co-dfns continues to improve. \r\n\r\nIf you are a commercial enterprise and do not wish or cannot use Gratipay, \r\nbut still wish to assist the project, contact Morten Kromberg of Dyalog, Ltd. \r\nvia email (mkrom@dyalog.com) to discuss other funding and support options.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
